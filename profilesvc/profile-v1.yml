    This API provides role-based access to create, read, and search profiles.
    
    In addition, this API provides the ability to update specific profile
    attributes as needed.


    Intended usage of this API is to search, get, and update (limited properties
    of)  profiles.


    **Profile.** The Profile resource contains characteristics from the MDM Type
    Hierarchy, as well as a collection of custom attributes and connection
    status.

    * Child of =      Profile

    * Parent of =     CustomAttribute

    * Pre-Requisite = None


    basePath: /connect/profile

    **Note: basepath root varies by HSDP region.**
